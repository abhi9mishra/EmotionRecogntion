Multimodal Emotion Recognition in a video using feature level fusion of audio and visual modalities.

Used SAVEE dataset having different emotions acted by more than 1000 different subjects. 

Dataset contains Six Major Emotions - Angry , Disgust , Fear , Happy , Sad , Surprise.

I am using Chehra Version.1 for detecting facial landmark points in each video frame and normalizing the landmark points coordinates in order to get visual feature.

For Classification I have used NNTool( Matlab ).

nnweights.mat File contains the trained model of neural network classifier.
